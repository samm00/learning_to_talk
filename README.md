Code archive for some of my work at the Learning to Talk Lab

In here, I have some of the work I have done for a study design by Michelle Erskine which aims to study dialect mismatch amongst African American English and General American English speakers. There are 2 experiments: DMSP & DMSI. 
The demo links are live here: 
- [DMSP] https://farm.pcibex.net/r/hdMMYZ/
- [DMSI] https://farm.pcibex.net/r/SCfcgs/

In this folder, there are randomization scripts to ensure fair and useful randomizations of trial orders according to certain constraints. This aims to maximize the efficacy of trial order, while still maintaining a truly random trial ordering. The output csvs are included in subdirectories.

The JavaScript files are PCIbex code for the respective experiments.

The CSS is the styling I did for the experiment.

#### More to come!
